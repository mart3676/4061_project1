Ganzorig wrote the helper function in the main program, and implemented the main function calls on the program and worked with Patrice on the fork/wait/exec calls within the main.c file, and debugging Phase 2. 

Raymond worked on the error checking as well as tweaking the exec calls in order to fix some of the problems that were occurring with this. He also worked on Phase 1 and laid out the skeleton of the main loops of the Phase 2 program.

Patrice set everything up in Github, formatted the code/comments in the main.c Phase 2 portion and completed documentation. Also worked on fork/wait/exec calls and their implementation within Phase 2, as well as debugging Phase 2.
